This python3 script is for exporting tracklists directly from an Ableton session file. Raison d'etre is that I thought there must be a way to do this that doesn't involve writing it down myself!

Upon executing, a file select window lets you select a .als file. The names and start times of all audioclips in the session are extracted, and converted into MM:SS format timestamps. Also a some attempts are made to remove anything from the clip names that is not Artist - Title.
