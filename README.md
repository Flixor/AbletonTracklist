This python3 script is for Ableton sessions that you've abused for long-form music dj mixes, so you don't have to write down the tracklist yourself lol.

Upon executing a file select window lets you select a .als file. The names and start times of all audioclips in the session are extracted from the .als file, and converted into MM:SS format timestamps. Also a feeble attmept is made to remove anything from the clip names that is not Artist - Title.

Also please shout at me if you know a nice way to make this executable for nubs like my friend, Callum
